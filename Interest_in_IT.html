							My interest in the IT field has started from a really young age, maybe at the age of five. At that time, we got a new computer our house and I was really excited to use it. While I was playing games on it, everyone in my family were surprised about how quickly I learnt how to use the computer and how to play those games. I think it was their reaction what motivated and encouraged me to develop interest in the IT field and of course the main reason for pursuing an IT degree would be to gain knowledge about  how developers build such fascinating and thrilling technology.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							Additionally, although there are a countless areas and fields in the technology industry, my interest has developed in the web-development area. This interest of mine has begun in year 8, where I have developed a small website for the first time. As I was developing the website, I realised how interesting and fun it was to produce my own website. Also, web-development is one of the high demand career in today’s era. Hence, this has driven me to pursue my studies in this area and gain knowledge and skills that are required to become a web-developer.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							Ever since I decided to fo in the IT field, I have been researching and asking friends, families and career counsellors about which university is the best to study Bachelor in Information Technology? Most of the answers that I received suggested me to apply for RMIT, since it the ‘top university’ to study  my course. As well as, the name itself states that RMIT is known for technology - Royal Melbourne Institute of TECHNOLOGY!! Therefore, I have chosen to undertake my course in RMIT to receive the best education that a is required to get into the career path I want to.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							During my studies at RMIT, I expect to gain the knowledge, skills as well as the thorough understandings of the concepts that are required to know for a web-developer. Furthermore, studying at RMIT allows and has allowed me to keep a track of my assignments along with obtaining the ability to manage myself in reference to time.
