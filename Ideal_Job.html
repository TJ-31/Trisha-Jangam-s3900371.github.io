However, due to a high interest, inspiration and encouragement from my family, I will build myself to the level where I can show myself as experienced person in the IT field. For now, I am a little bit fine with HTML coding since it is seen and shown as the most basic coding, hence I feel confident with HTML coding. Additionally, I have recently started learning CSS coding and definitely I can say it is more complicated than HTML since it has a number of different tags as well as it produces a more appealing website compared to HTML coding.
