							Project Idea:- Scan it
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							The project idea that I have in mind is an app that will be used by people who are visually impaired. The app I want to develop is called “Scan it”. This app will enable people with visual disabilities to scan the product they want so that they can know what the product they are holing in their hand is. When the app finishes scanning the product, it will detect exactly what it is and speak out the details of the product, letting the user know what the product or item is. For example, if a user who has visual disability downloads this app and goes shopping, then if they don’t know what product they are holding or want to know information about that product, then this app — 'Scan it’, will be able to let them know all the details they want in order for the user to know if that is the right product they are looking for. Additionally, ‘Scan it’ isn’t only for products or food items, it can be used for almost everything, things such as, transport — letting the user know when the next train or bus is by scanning the screen. 
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							I believe that in our everyday life, we see a number of people holding a stick struggling to find their way out or in and these days people are busy where they don’t have enough time to explain details unless they work in that particular area. So, I think this app will be really useful for users with visual disabilities because they will also gain the chance to live a normal life without having to ask others for help when they can do it by themselves with a single scan. Although there are other programs similar to this app, I think by adding in the voice feature, it will be more interesting to develop this.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							'Scan it' is an app that will enable visually impaired users to use it so that it will make their access easy whenever they go shopping or travelling anywhere. For the users to be able to download this app, they may require someone’s help/assistance in order to register into the app. However, once the registration for the app has been done, the user interface and the navigation system will be set in a easy mode, where the users will be able to understand and access the app with ease. This is due to the voice system which the users will enable it on their phone settings for the app so that they will be able to ask questions just with the use of their voice, allowing them to not having to type the question instead.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							There are a number of different features and advantages in this app which allows visually impaired users to experience that they might not have don’t or couldn’t do. For example, it it really common to buy wrong products when they go shopping and to solve this issue and help them to not waste their money, ‘Scan it’ will be able to scan the product and clearly explain what the product they are holding, leading to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their money and time.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							Furthermore, other features that come with this app are being able to ‘see’ what is in front of them and things such as train or bus timings. When I say ‘see’, I mean that although they can’t physically see, ‘Scan it’ will make or read out the descriptions was if they are visually viewing it with their own eyes so that they don’t get confused. For example, when users open the app, it opens up with a plain screen showing a camera symbol. When they click on the icon and place their phone on front of the road where their might be a bin in their way, ‘Scan it’ will say that — “there is a bin in front of you”. This will allow the users to avoid any small or big accidents while walking down the streets. Consequently, ‘Scan it’ has many different characteristics to help visually impaired users. 
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							In the IT industry, there are various software tools that are required to develop this app such as an API, which will be used to connect the app to the server. Since ‘Scan it’ is for visually impaired users, it will be user friendly and ease of use where they won’t have to face any problems when setting up the app. Additionally, a tool to test the app is required such as Selenium testing, where it will allow developers to validate the application so that we can know the efficiency and effectiveness of the app. Furthermore, the other software tools that are needed to develop this app are programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScripts, etc.  
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							Mainly, to be able to develop or create an app, it is a minimum requirement to have a high experience and a high-standard understanding of the programming languages — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Since this app focused on both OS and iOS users, I will need to gain even more complex coding knowledge in order to be able to produce a ‘Scan it’ app, so that both Apple and Android users won’t have problems when using the app.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 20px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
							In future, if ‘Scan it’ becomes successful, I believe that the outcome will be positive since it will enable many visually impaired users to travel anywhere and everywhere without having to face any troubles or concerns due to the efficient app that will give access and help to them when necessary. As well as, it will help many visually impaired users in day-to-day life. Hence, most visually impaired users will gain the confidence to go out and find it easy to discover any information or places they want to know about without having to ask others for help or assistance.
